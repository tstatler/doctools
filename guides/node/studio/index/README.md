# Studio 

You can use Appcelerator or Titanium Studio to create, run, manage and debug Node.ACS services.
The `acs` command-line utility needs to be installed to manage Node.ACS projects by Studio.

## Installing or Updating Node.ACS

By default, Studio prompts you to install or update Node.ACS if it needs updating each time
Studio starts.

To manually check for an update, from the menu bar, select **Help** > **Check for Appcelerator
Updates** or **Check for Titanium Updates**.

## Managing Node.ACS Projects

There are two kinds of custom cloud projects you can manage with Studio:

  1. **Standalone**. Only contains code for your Node.ACS service.
  2. **Integrated**. Contains both a Node.ACS service and mobile client application.

See the following topics for information on managing Node.ACS projects with Studio.

  * [Integrated Projects](#!/guide/node_studio_integrated)
