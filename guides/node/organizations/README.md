# Node.ACS Organization Support #



Organization support is an enterprise feature. Organizations are derived from 360. Node.ACS does not define organizations.

There may be several organizations for an enterprise. 
An user may belong to multiple organizations.
All members (administrators and normal members) of an organization share apps of the organization. Any member has access to Node.ACS can make any change to any app in an organization.
App name should be unique in an organization as well as for an user.
Avery app should be assigned to exact one organization. 
Existing apps will not be assigned to any organization before migration.
