# Using the REST API 

Appcelerator Cloud Services provides a REST API accessible from any networked client
device for creating, querying, updating, and deleting ACS objects.

Each ACS object supports a set of methods, which are documented in the [API reference](#!/api).

## REST API Basics

Each of the REST API methods has its own URL and HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE).

To make an API call, you make an HTTP request. Method parameters are passed in the URL query string or in the 
message body, depending on the HTTP method. 

For GET and DELETE requests, send the parameters in the URL itself as part of the URL query
string. For example:

    https://api.cloud.appcelerator.com/v1/checkins/show.json?key=<YOUR APP APP KEY>&checkin_id=4d8bc645d0afbe0363000013

For POST and PUT requests, you send an HTTP request with the `multipart/form-data` media
type, where each parameter is sent as a separate form field.

API responses are returned as JSON objects. In most cases, the response JSON includes two objects:

*   `meta`. Object containing response metadata, including the response status code and error message,
    if any.

*   `response`. Object containing the actual data for the request. The `response` object is 
    omitted for some requests, such as delete requests, that return no data.

## Authentication

All API calls must contain a valid App Key, 3-Legged OAuth Access Token, or
2-Legged OAuth signature and request header in order for the ACS
server to process and respond to them. See the [authentication page](#!/guide/acs_authentication) 
for more information.

## User Sessions and Cookies

To create a user and perform actions which require a logged-in user,
the `session_id` cookie must be saved and reused with each API call.

To get a session ID, use the `users/login.json` method to login in to the application.  If the API
call is successful, the `session_id` field is returned in the `meta` object of the response.
For example:

    curl -F "login=admin" -F "password=admin" "https://api.cloud.appcelerator.com/v1/users/login.json?key=<API_KEY>"
    {
      "meta": {
        "code": 200,
        "status": "ok",
        "method_name": "loginUser",
        "session_id": "sjuvQqSEYTD3DekMCrUHcCTf7GU"
      },
      "response": {
        "users": [
          {
            "id": "526edc0d294e712499000004",
            "created_at": "2013-10-28T21:50:05+0000",
            "updated_at": "2013-12-05T01:02:32+0000",
            "external_accounts": [
            ],
            "confirmed_at": "2013-10-28T21:50:05+0000",
            "username": "admin",
            "role": "",
            "admin": "true",
            "stats": {
              "photos": {
                "total_count": 0
              },
              "storage": {
                "used": 0
              }
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }


Pass the `session_id` value to the `_session_id` parameter in the URL, for example:

    https://api.cloud.appcelerator.com/v1/reviews/create.json?key=<API_KEY>&_session_id=<SESSION_ID>

With the cURL command, use the `-b` and `-c` options to read and write cookies to store your session
ID. Many of the REST examples in the documentation use these options.

User login sessions expire after they have been unused for a period of time.
By default, the expiration period is six months. You can configure the user session 
expiration period in the application management console.

## Testing with cURL and wget

[cURL](http://curl.haxx.se) and [wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget) are
both excellent tools for quickly testing ACS API calls from
the command line. Using these commands can help you determine what calls to make
and show you the JSON output that your app receives. cURL is included with
OS X, and can easily be used from the Terminal application:
    
    $ curl --verbose -b cookies.txt -c cookies.txt https://api.cloud.appcelerator.com/v1/places/search.json?key=vvCNPSh1cd0Gb5A6tWZAIC4MngO95mGs
    
Use the `-b cookies.txt` and `-c cookies.txt` options to save and reuse the
`_session_id` cookie sent from the ACS server. The `--verbose`
option is useful for seeing all of the HTTP header and cookie information sent
and received by the ACS server.
    
    $ curl --verbose -b cookies.txt -c cookies.txt -F "login=mike@appcelerator.com" -F "password=food" https://api.cloud.appcelerator.com/v1/users/login.json?key=vjCQ6KRqplmkektlpbEjiDQ2nYReubkP

            "email":"mike@appcelerator.com"
          }
        ]
      }	
    }
    
## Uploading Photos
  
The `create` (POST) and `update` (PUT) methods for many objects such as
`Users`, `Checkins`, and `Photos` take an optional `photo` or `file` parameter
to send a photo. The binary data must be sent in a form with Content-Type
`multipart/form-data`, and the content type of the `photo` or `file` must be
`image/jpeg`, `image/png`, or `image/gif`.  
  
When using cURL, uploading a photo can be done easily by using `@` in front of
the filename, such as `@photo.jpg`, to specify that the file should be
attached.
    
    $ curl --verbose -b cookies.txt -c cookies.txt -F "photo=@photo.jpg" -F "message=At the beach" https://api.cloud.appcelerator.com/v1/statuses/create.json?key=<API_KEY>
    
## Object IDs
  
All returned data objects contain unique IDs which are 24-digit hexadecimal
strings. These IDs may be use to efficiently return data for a single object:
    
    GET https://api.cloud.appcelerator.com/v1/places/show/**4d6f13e96f70953608000012**.json?key=<API_KEY>
    
    {
      "meta": {
        "stat":"ok",
        "code":200,
        "method":"showPlace"
      },
      "response": {
        "places": [
          {
              "id":"4d6f13e96f70953608000012",
              "name":"Maya Restaurant",
              "created_at":"2011-03-03T04:07:05+0000",
              "updated_at":"2011-03-03T04:07:05+0000",
              "address":"303 2nd Street",
              "city":"San Francisco",
              "state":"CA",
              "country":"United States",
              "phone":"(415) 543-2928",
              "lat":37.784732,
              "lng":-122.395441	
          }
        ]
      }	
    }
    
## Response Paging

API calls which return arrays of objects take optional `page` and `per_page`
arguments to specify the number of objects to return. By default, ten objects
are returned on each page, and the request may specify up to 20 results per
page. Page numbers start at 1; if unspecified, the page defaults to page 1.

Data about the current page is included in the `meta` object. For paged responses,
the `meta` object includes the `page`, `per_page`, `total_pages` and `total_results` keys:

    "meta": {
      "status":"ok",
      "code":200,
      "method_name":"showThreadMessages",
      "page":1,
      "per_page":10,
      "total_pages":1,
      "total_results":3
    },
