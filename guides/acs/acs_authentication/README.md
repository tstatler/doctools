# Authentication

To keep your application data secure from unauthorized access, your application must prove that it 
is allowed to communicate with ACS in each HTTP request. There are two ways your application can do this:

* Application key over SSL
* 2-Legged OAuth

To authenticate user access to individual ACS data objects within your application, such as {@link Photos}
or {@link Files}, you can use access control lists (ACLs). See {@link ACLs Access Control Lists} for more information.

## Application Key over SSL

The easiest way to authenticate API requests to ACS is to supply an ACS app key with each request 
as a URL parameter, for example:

<pre class="prettyprint">GET https://api.cloud.appcelerator.com/v1/places/search.json?<b>key=<span class="display_key">&lt;YOUR_APP_KEY&gt;</span></b></pre>

ACS defaults to using application key over SSL.

**To locate your application key in Dashboard**:

1. Open [Dashboard](https://dashboard.appcelerator.com) in your browser and select your application
from the App menu.
2. From the left-hand navigation, select **Cloud > Configuration**.
3. On the **Keys** tab, click **Show** next to the **App Key** label to show your app key.

Community users obtain their application key from the [My Apps](https://my.appcelerator.com/apps) page.

## 2-Legged OAuth

If SSL is not available to the client application, ACS also provides secure authentication via 2-Legged OAuth. 
In this process, an authentication key and secret are used to sign each request made 
by your application to ACS. When the ACS server receives the request, the secret and the data 
sent in the request are used to calculate another signature. If the received and calculated signatures match, 
the request is processed.

Over a non-SSL connection, OAuth is more secure than the application key approach, as 
the secret used to generate the signature is known only by the app and the ACS server; it is never 
sent over the network.

Below is an example of an OAuth HTTP header:

<pre class="prettyprint">
Authorization: OAuth oauth_consumer_key="0685bd9184jfhq22",
        oauth_token="",
        oauth_signature_method="HMAC-SHA1",
        oauth_signature="wOJIO9A2W5mFwDgiDvZbTSMK%2FPY%3D",
        oauth_timestamp="137131200",
        oauth_nonce="4572616e48616d6d65724c61686176",
        oauth_version="1.0"
</pre>
 
**To locate your OAuth consumer key and secret in Dashboard**:

1. Open [Dashboard](https://dashboard.appcelerator.com) and select your application
from the App menu.
2. From the left-hand navigation, select **Cloud > Configuration**.
3. On the **Keys** tab, click **Show** next to the **OAuth Consumer Key** and **OAuth Secret** labels.

Community users obtain their OAuth consumer key and secret from the [My Apps](https://my.appcelerator.com/apps)
web console.

### OAuth example

Most OAuth libraries that support standard (3-Legged) OAuth&mdash;such as those used by Facebook, Twitter, 
and others&mdash;also supports 2-legged OAuth. The following is an example of making a 2-Legged 
OAuth request using Ruby. Provide your ACS OAuth consumer key and secret for the `consumer_key` and
`consumer_secret` fields. Use an empty string ("") as both the Access Token and Secret.

<pre class="prettyprint">
require 'rubygems'
require 'oauth'

# make the consumer out of your secret and key
consumer_key = "<ACS OAuth Consumer Key>"
consumer_secret = "<ACS OAuth Secret>"
consumer = OAuth::Consumer.new(consumer_key, consumer_secret, :site => "http://api.cloud.appcelerator.com")

# make the access token from your consumer
access_token = OAuth::AccessToken.new consumer

# make a signed request!
response = access_token.get("/v1/places/search.json")

# show the response
puts response.body
</pre>

## Access Control Lists (ACLs)

Access Control Lists (ACLs) provide several APIs to implement access control lists for ACS
objects. An access control list controls read and write access to ACS objects it's
attached to. Please refer to {@link ACLs Access Control Lists} for more information.
