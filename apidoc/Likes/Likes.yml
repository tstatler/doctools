name: Likes
description: |
    This flexible object lets you add a "like" to an existing object.
    
    Currently, likes can only be added to the following object types:
    
    *   {@link Posts}
    *   {@link Photos}
    *   {@link Users}
    *   {@link Events}
    *   {@link Checkins}
    *   {@link Places}
    *   {@link CustomObjects}
    *   {@link Statuses}
    *   {@link Reviews}
      
    If an object has one or more likes associated to it, it will return a total
    like count with the object:  

        "likes_count": 2
