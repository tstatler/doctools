    The Likes API lets you add a "like" to an existing object. Currently, likes can only be added to 
    the following object types:
    
    *   {@link Posts}
    *   {@link Photos}
    *   {@link Users}
    *   {@link Events}
    *   {@link Checkins}
    *   {@link Places}
    *   {@link CustomObjects}
    *   {@link Statuses}
    *   {@link Reviews}
      
    If an object has one or more likes associated to it, it will return a total
    like count with the object:  

        "likes_count": 2

    ## Determining if the Current User Likes an Object

    To determine if the current user has liked an ACS object, use the {@link Likes#method-query Likes.query}
    method to retrieve a list of objects the user liked.

    If you are executing a `query` or `show` method on the ACS object, pass `show_user_like=true`
    as a parameter to the method. If the current user liked an object returned by
    either of those methods, the response object contains the field `"current_user_liked: true"`.

    See the REST API examples for the {@link Checkins#method-query Checkins.query} 
    and {@link Checkins#method-show Checkins.show} methods for details.
