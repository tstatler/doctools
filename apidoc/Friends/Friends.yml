name: Friends
description: |
    The Friends API provides methods for managing friendships between the current user and another user.
    
    By default, friendships are two-way (like Facebook): once a friend request 
    is made and approved, both users will show up in each others' friend lists. 
    This default behavior can be changed to one-way following (like
    Twitter) in the Cloud > Settings & Configuration tab in [Appcelerator Dashboard](https://dashboard.appcelerator.com)
    or the Settings tab [My Apps](https://my.appcelerator.com/apps).
