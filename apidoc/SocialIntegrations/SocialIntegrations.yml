    The SocialIntegrations object lets users link their existing ACS accounts to their social network accounts
    (Facebook or Twitter, for example) and login to ACS using their social network account credentials. You 
    can also search for a user's Facebook friends who have installed the same application and linked their Facebook account to ACS.
