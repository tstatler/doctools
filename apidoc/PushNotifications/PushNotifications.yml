    The Push Notifications API lets you send push notification to your users who are on iOS and
    Andriod Devices. You can also send a system push notification to all users from the Admin
    Console.

    Please refer to the Push Notifications sections of the [Android SDK guide](#!/guide/android)
    or the [iOS SDK guide](#!/guide/ios) to set up your app for push notifications to
    Android or iOS.
