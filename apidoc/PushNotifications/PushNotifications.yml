    The Push Notifications API lets you send push notifications to your users who are on iOS and
    Android Devices. You can also send a system push notification to all users from the Admin
    Console.

    Please refer to the Push Notifications sections of the [Android SDK guide](#!/guide/android)
    or the [iOS SDK guide](#!/guide/ios) to set up your app for push notifications to
    Android or iOS.

    To setup Titanium applications, refer to the
    [Push Notification guide](http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#!#!/guide/Push_Notifications).

    The Push Notifications API provides two mechanisms to register and send push notifications.  One
    relies on the user session, which requires the user to be logged in to receive push notifications.
    The other method uses devices tokens, which does not require the user to be logged in to
    receive notifications.  If you are using the Titanium API, push notifications with device tokens
    require Titanium SDK 3.1.2 and later.

    ### Android Notes

    #### Protocol Support

    For Android devices, ACS supports either Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) or MQTT.  MQTT is being
    deprecated in favor of using GCM.  If you have an existing application using MQTT, transition it
    to use GCM.  All new applications should use GCM.

    #### Device Support

    GCM supports devices that run Android 2.2 and later, and requires that the Google Play Store
    application be installed. For pre-4.0 devices, the user is required to set up their Google account.

    #### Optional Payload Fields

    On Android, you can specify the following optional fields in the `payload` parameter of the
    {@link PushNotifications#notify_tokens} or {@link PushNotifications#notify} method:

      * `icon` (String): Filename minus the extension of the
        icon to display in the notification center. Place the file in `/res/drawable`
        for Android applications or `/Resources` for Titanium applications.
        Uses the app's icon by default.
      * `title` (String): Title of the notification.
      * `vibrate` (Boolean): If true, the device vibrates for one second.


    ### Badges

    When sending a push notification, you can specify a badge value, which is usually used to indicate the
    number of unread messages or other content waiting to be addressed by the user in your application.

    On Android, the badge number is displayed in the notification center, while on iOS, the badge
    number is displayed with the application icon.

    When setting the value of the badge, you can either directly set the badge number, or
    increment and decrement the current value of the badge. Set the `badge` field in the `payload`
    parameter of the {@link PushNotifications#notify_tokens} or {@link PushNotifications#notify}
    method to specify a value for the badge.

    Prefix the number with either the `+` or `-` symbol to increment or decrement the current value,
    respectively.  Omit the prefix to directly set the value.

    For example, the value `+2` increments the current badge value by two, the value `-1`,
    decrements the badge value by one, and the value `12` sets the badge value to twelve.

    Use the following methods to set the internally stored value of the badge and not update the
    displayed value in the application:

      * {@link PushNotifications#set_badge}: set, increment or decrement the value of the badge
      * [reset_badge](#!/api/PushNotifications-method-reset_badge_put): set the value of the badge to zero

    To update the displayed value in the application, you need to send a push notification with the
    `badge` field defined.


    ### Push Notifications with Device Tokens

    The methods with the `_token` suffix rely on the device's token to subscribe, receive, send or
    unsubscribe from push notifications:

      * {@link PushNotifications#subscribe_token}
      * {@link PushNotifications#notify_tokens}
      * {@link PushNotifications#unsubscribe_token}

    To retrieve your device token using the Android or iOS SDK API, refer to the
    Push Notifications sections of the [Android SDK guide](#!/guide/android)
    or the [iOS SDK guide](#!/guide/ios).

    To retrieve your device token using the Titanium SDK API:

      * For Android, use the
        [Titanium.CloudPush](http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#!/api/Titanium.CloudPush)
        module.

      * For iOS, use the
        [Titanium.Network.registerForPushNotifications](http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#!/api/Titanium.Network-method-registerForPushNotifications)
        method.

    ### Push Notifications with User Sessions

    The following methods require the user to be logged in to subscribe, receive or unsubscribe from
    push notifications:

      * {@link PushNotifications#subscribe}
      * {@link PushNotifications#notify}
      * {@link PushNotifications#unsubscribe}

    To send push notifications, the `notify.json` method uses the user's ID.

    You can also use the {@link Users#logout} method to unsubscribe from all push notifications by
    specifying the `device_id` parameter.
