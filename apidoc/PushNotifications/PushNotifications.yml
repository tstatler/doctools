    The Push Notifications API lets you send push notification to your users who are on iOS and
    Andriod Devices. You can also send a system push notification to all users from the Admin
    Console.

    Please refer to the Push Notifications sections of the [Android SDK guide](#!/guide/android)
    or the [iOS SDK guide](#!/guide/ios) to set up your app for push notifications to
    Android or iOS.

    For methods that require device tokens, to retrieve your device token using the Titanium SDK API:

      * For Android, use the
        [Titanium.CloudPush](http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#!/api/Titanium.CloudPush)
        module.

      * For iOS, use the
        [Titanium.Network.registerForPushNotifications](http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#!/api/Titanium.Network-method-registerForPushNotifications)
        method.
