    The Push Notifications API lets you send push notification to your users who are on iOS and
    Andriod Devices. You can also send a system push notification to all users from the Admin
    Console.

    Please refer to the Push Notifications sections of the [Android SDK guide](#!/guide/android)
    or the [iOS SDK guide](#!/guide/ios) to set up your app for push notifications to
    Android or iOS.

    To setup Titanium applications, refer to the
    [Push Notification guide](http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#!#!/guide/Push_Notifications).

    The Push Notifications API provides two mechanisms to register and send push notifications.  One
    relies on the user session, which requires the user to be logged in to receive push notifications.
    The other method uses devices tokens, which does not require the user to be logged in to
    receive notifications.

    ### Push Notifications with Device Tokens

    The methods with the `_token` suffix rely on the device's token to subscribe, receive, send or
    unsubscribe from push notifications:

      * {@link PushNotifications#subscribe_token}
      * {@link PushNotifications#notify_tokens}
      * {@link PushNotifications#unsubscribe_token}

    To retrieve your device token using the Android or iOS SDK API, refer to the
    Push Notifications sections of the [Android SDK guide](#!/guide/android)
    or the [iOS SDK guide](#!/guide/ios).

    To retrieve your device token using the Titanium SDK API:

      * For Android, use the
        [Titanium.CloudPush](http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#!/api/Titanium.CloudPush)
        module.

      * For iOS, use the
        [Titanium.Network.registerForPushNotifications](http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#!/api/Titanium.Network-method-registerForPushNotifications)
        method.

    ### Push Notifications with User Sessions

    The following methods require the user to be logged in to subscribe, receive or unsubscribe from
    push notifications:

      * {@link PushNotifications#subscribe}
      * {@link PushNotifications#notify}
      * {@link PushNotifications#unsubscribe}

    To send push notifications, the `notify.json` method uses the user's ID.

    You can also use the {@link Users#logout} method to unsubscribe from all push notifications by
    specifying the `device_id` parameter.
