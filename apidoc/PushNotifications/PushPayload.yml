name: PushPayload
pseudo: true
description: |
    JSON payload to pass to either the {@link PushNotifications#notify} or
    {@link PushNotifications#notify_tokens} method.

    In addition to the fields below, you can also add custom fields to pass on to the client
    application.  Note that all field names defined below are reserved keywords and should not be used as custom
    field names.

    For example, if you send the following payload:

        {
            "alert": "Sample alert",
            "badge": "+2",
            "category": "sampleCategory", 
            "icon": "little_star",
            "sound": "door_bell",
            "title": "Example",
            "vibrate": true,
            "custom_field_1": "Appcelerator Cloud Services Rocks!",
            "custom_field_2": "Hi Push"
        }

    Then, the client application will:

      * Display the `Sample alert` message.
      * Increment the current badge value by two.
      * Play the `door_bell` sound.
      * If the device is Android, the notification title will be `Example`, the device will
        vibrate and the `little_star` icon will be displayed in the notification.
      * If the device is running iOS 8 or later, it will display the user notification actions
        associated with the `sampleCategroy` user notifiation category.

    Additionally, the client application will be passed the `custom_field_1` and `custom_field_2`
    keys, which are custom fields that the client application can parse in the delivered JSON object.

    The notification payload delivered to the client application is modified and is a bit different
    between Android and iOS.

    For Android, all Android-valid fields are contained in an `android` dictionary, while all other
    iOS-only and custom fields are top-level keys of the payload.  For example, the original
    payload in the example will be delivered to an Android application as:


        {
            "android": {
                "title": "Example",
                "alert": "Sample alert",
                "icon": "little_star",
                "badge": "+2",
                "sound": "door_bell",
                "vibrate": true,
            },
            "category": "sampleCategory",
            "custom_field_1": "Appcelerator Cloud Services Rocks!",
            "custom_field_2": "Hi Push"
        }

    For iOS, all iOS-valid fields are contained in an `aps` dictionary, while all other
    Android-only and custom fields are top-level keys of the payload. For example, the original
    payload in the example will be delivered to an iOS application as:

        {
            "aps": {
                "alert": "Sample alert",
                "badge": "+2",
                "category": "sampleCategory",
                "sound": "door_bell",
            },
            "title": "Example",
            "icon": "little_star",
            "vibrate": true,
            "custom_field_1": "Appcelerator Cloud Services Rocks!",
            "custom_field_2": "Hi Push"
        }
