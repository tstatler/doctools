    summary: Deletes multiple Users objects.
    description: | 
        Deletes Users objects that match the query constraints provided in the `where` parameter.
        If no `where` parameter is provided, all Users objects are deleted. 
        Note that an HTTP 200 code (success)
        is returned if the call completed successfully but the query matched no objects.

        For performance reasons, the number of objects that can be deleted in a single batch delete 
        operation is limited to 100,000.

        The matched objects are deleted asynchronously in a separate process.      

        The {@link #photo primary photos} associated with the matched objects are 
        not deleted. 

        You must be an application admin to run this command.
