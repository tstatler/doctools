    This flexible object lets you add a "like" to an existing object.
    
    Currently, likes can only be added to the following object types:
    
    *   {@link Post}
    *   {@link Photo}
    *   {@link User}
    *   {@link Event}
    *   {@link Checkin}
    *   {@link Place}
    *   {@link CustomObject}
    *   {@link Status}
    *   {@link Review}
      
    If an object has one or more likes associated to it, it will return a total
    like count with the object:  

        "likes_count": 2
