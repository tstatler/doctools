    The Chats API provides methods for sending chat messages from one user to another user,
    or to a group of users called a _chat group_.

    Chat groups are formed implicitly when users send chat messages. For example, if 
    user A sends a message to users B and C, a chat group is formed with users A, B, and
    C. If user C subsequently sends a message to user B, a second chat group is formed with users B
    and C as members.

    If you have configured push notifications for your application, you can optionally 
    specify to a send push notifications to message recipients' devices as well.
