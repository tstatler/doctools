    The Chat object provides an API to send chat messages from one user to another user
    or a group of users. If you have configured push notification in your app, you
    can send optional push notifications to the recipients' devices as well.

    Chat groups are formed implicitly when users send chat messages. For example, if 
    user A sends a message to users B and C, an chat group is formed with users A, B, and
    C. If user C subsequently sends a message to user B, a second chat group is formed with users B
    and C as members.
