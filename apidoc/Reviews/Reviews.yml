    The Reviews API lets you associate user reviews and ratings with an ACS object. Currently, reviews 
    can be added to the following ACS object types:

    *   {@link Posts}
    *   {@link Photos}
    *   {@link Users}
    *   {@link Events}
    *   {@link Checkins}
    *   {@link Places}
    *   {@link CustomObjects} 
    *   {@link Statuses}
    *   {@link Reviews}
    
    If an ACS object has one or more reviews associated with it, it returns the total
    number of reviews, number of ratings, average rating value, and a summary of ratings when the object is 
    queried or updated:

        "reviews_count": 2,
        "ratings_count": 2,
        "ratings_average": 150.0,
        "ratings_summary": {
              "100": 1,
                "200": 1
        }
