    This flexible Tangram lets you add reviews with optional ratings to an existing object You
    can use it to create reviews with rating, comments(text only), or Likes(rating only). You
    can also create reviews to review objects to create comments on comments, etc.
    
    
    Currently, reviews can be added to the following object types:

    *   {@link Posts}
    *   {@link Photos}
    *   {@link Users}
    *   {@link Events}
    *   {@link Checkins}
    *   {@link Places}
    *   {@link CustomObjects} 
    *   {@link Statuses}
    *   {@link Reviews} -- Create comments on reviews/comments, etc.
    
    If an object has one or more reviews(comments) associated to it, it will return a total
    review count, rating_count, average rating and a breakdown of each rating value:

        "reviews_count": 2,
        "ratings_count": 2,
        "ratings_average": 150.0,
