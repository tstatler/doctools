name: Friend
description: |
    Provides APIs for managing friendships between the current user and another user.
    
    By default friendships are two-way (like Facebook), so after a friend request 
    is made and approved both users will show up in each others' friend lists. 
    This default can be changed to one-way following (like
    Twitter) in the App Settings for each of your apps.
